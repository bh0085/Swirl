README for Swirl v.1

A scattered collection of IDL scripts for processing images of 
gas giants, finding cloud features, and determining curl and 
divergence.

In its rudimentary current form, Swirl lacks documentation and
will not work independently of a few still unpackaged programs.
These are coming!

Swirl currently has a few dependencies outside of the repo:
      --Fanning libraries available at 
      		http://www.dfanning.com/documents/programs.html

      --Misc utilities yet unpublished that will be included in this repo.


--TODO--
	1) Include supplementary utilities necessary for basic function.
	2) Documentation and usage examples.
	3) Improved organization and deletion - separation of the wheat from
	   the chaff.
	4) Algorithm improvement: a) addition of new correlation techniques 
	   	     		  b) streamlining and packaging of current ones
				
	5) FUTURE: a) standalone version capable of running as an app in the
	   	      idl virtual machine.

Thanks especially to:
       Tony DelGenio without whose support and friendly guidance this project
       	    could not have happened,
       John Barbara whose data and smarts made everything work better.

       Peter Gierasch with whom this entire project was begin in the first
       	    and who believed that it could work.

Expect a working version before 7/15/10.
